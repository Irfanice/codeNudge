Manually found few bugs

Not a bug but mentioning: Dark mode not handled

Track Story
1. An existing user generates 2 stories -> Clicks the Delete button, but the story of the deleted user is still
displayed -> The session should be terminated.

2. When clicking left on the second person's first story, it should navigate to the first person's last story.
Currently, it navigates to the first person's first story.

UI Bug:
3. The second story’s display picture (DP) appears on the landing page, but when we click on the story and open it,
 the second story’s DP is not displayed at the top left.

Track Quiz
4. When taking a quiz with a 60-second timer per question, if you close the app while answering a question,
the timer continues to run in the background for that question. For example, if you close the app during the first
question and reopen it after 5 minutes, the quiz will resume from the second question

5. Edge case: When increasing the font and display size to large, the button text shrinks downward within the
button. The UI should handle this properly.

Common
6. Landscape mode is not responsive [Handle or resctrict landscape mode]
